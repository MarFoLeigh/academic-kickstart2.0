Welcome to my site! This website has been created for Prof. Shawn Graham's [*Digital Guerrilla Public History*](https://github.com/shawngraham/guerrilla-dh/wiki) course at Carleton University. Here, I will be posting devlogs - aka development logs - tracking my work, experiences, and discoveries during the course of the semester.   

Here we go!
